    <p class="w3-justify">Dumbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise.
He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair,
struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were
all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and
packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying
him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s
right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring
her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting
to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined
not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase,
so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody
called him back, broke into a very fast walk..</p>
